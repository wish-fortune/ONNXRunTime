				Most modern ML models are developed with PyTorch. The agility and flexibility that PyTorch
				provides for creating and training models has made it the most popular deep learning
				framework today. The typical workflow is to train these models in the cloud and run them
				from the cloud as well. However, many scenarios are arising that make it more attractive -
				or in some cases, required - to run locally on device. These include:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
				<li>
					Avoiding network round-trips to the cloud (for example in audio and video processing)
				</li>
				<li>Keeping user data on device (for privacy protection or regulatory requirements)</li>
				<li>
					High cost of cloud resources (especially when device capabilities are underutilized)
				</li>
				<li>Application requirements to operate without internet connectivity</li>
			</ul>

			<img
				src={ORT}
				alt="Diagram showing the PyTorch logo representing a PyTorch model, fanning out to icons for web, mobile and browser devices running ONNX Runtime"
				class="mb-4 w-3/4 mx-auto"
			/>

			<p class="mb-4">
				In this article, we'll demystify running PyTorch models on the edge. We define 'edge' as
				anywhere that is outside of the cloud, ranging from large, well-resourced personal computers
				to small footprint devices such as mobile phones. This has been a challenging task to
				accomplish in the past, but new advances in model optimization and software like
				<a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/pytorch" class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">ONNX Runtime</a>
				make it more feasible - even for new generative AI and large language models like Stable Diffusion,
				Whisper, and Llama2.
			</p>

			<h2 class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline text-3xl mb-4">Considerations for PyTorch models on the edge</h2>

			<p class="mb-4">
				There are several factors to keep in mind when thinking about running a PyTorch model on the
				edge:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
				<li class="mb-2">
					<strong>Size</strong>: modern models can be several gigabytes (hence the name Large
					Language Models!). On the cloud, size is usually not a consideration until it becomes too
					large to fit on a single GPU. At that point there are various well-known solutions for
					running across multiple GPUs. For edge devices, we need to find models that can fit within
					the constraints of the device. This sometimes requires a tradeoff with quality. Most
					modern models come in several sizes (1 billion parameters, 13 billion parameters, 70
					billion parameters, etc) so you can select a variant that fits on your device. Techniques
					such as quantization are usually applied to reduce the number of bits representing
					parameters, further reducing the model size. The size of the application is also
					constrained by the app stores, so bringing in gigabytes of libraries won't work on the
					edge.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-2">
					<strong>API for application integration</strong>: on the cloud, models are usually
					packaged as Docker containers that expose an endpoint that is called by an application or
					service. On edge devices, Docker containers may take up too many resources or may not even
					be supported. By using an optimized engine, like ONNX Runtime, the dependency on Python
					and Docker containers can be eliminated. ONNX Runtime also has APIs in many languages
					including C, C++, C#, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C and Swift for making it easier
					to integrate natively with the hosting application.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-2">
					<strong>Performance</strong>: with large amounts of memory, no power restrictions, and
					hefty compute capabilities, running non-optimized models on the cloud is possible. On edge
					devices, these luxuries do not exist and optimization is crucial. For example, ONNX
					Runtime optimizes memory allocations, fuses model operators, reduces kernel launch times,
					minimizes tensor transfers between processing units, and applies tuned matrix math
					algorithms. It's also able to make use of compilers and engines that are device-specific,
					providing a common interface for your application while harnessing the best approach on
					each device.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-2">
					<strong>Maintainability</strong>: on the cloud, updating a model is as simple as deploying
					a new container image and ramping up traffic. On the edge, you need to consider how you
					will distribute model updates. Sometimes this involves publishing updates to an app store,
					sometimes it might be possible to implement a data update mechanism within your app and
					download new model files or maybe even deltas. There are many possible paths, so we won't
					go into much depth on this topic in this article but it's an aspect to keep in mind as you
					plan for production.
				</li>
				<li class="mb-2">
					<strong>Hybrid</strong>: instead of cloud versus device, you can choose to utilize both.
					There are several hybrid patterns that are used in production today by applications such
					as Office. One pattern is to dynamically decide whether to run on the device or in the
					cloud based on network conditions or input characteristics. Another pattern is to run part
					of the model pipeline on the device and part on the cloud. This is especially useful with
					modern model pipelines that have separate encoder and decoder stages. Using an engine like
					ONNX Runtime that works on both cloud and device simplifies development. We'll discuss
					hybrid scenarios in more detail in a forthcoming article.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Personalization</strong>: in many cases, the PyTorch model is simply being run on
					the device. However, you may also have scenarios where you need to personalize the model
					on the device without sending data to the cloud. Recommendation and content targeting are
					example scenarios that can improve their quality by updating models based on activity on
					the device. Fine tuning and training with PyTorch on the device may not feasible (due to
					performance and size concerns) but using an engine like ONNX Runtime allows PyTorch models
					to be updated and personalized locally. The same mechanism also enabled federated
					learning, which can help mitigate user data exposure.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline text-3xl mb-4">Tools for PyTorch models on the edge</h2>

			<p class="mb-4">
				We mentioned ONNX Runtime several times above. ONNX Runtime is a compact, standards-based
				engine that has deep integration with PyTorch. By using PyTorch's ONNX APIs, your PyTorch
				models can run on a spectrum of edge devices with ONNX Runtime.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				The first step for running PyTorch models on the edge is to get them into a lightweight
				format that doesn't require the PyTorch framework and its gigabytes of dependencies. PyTorch
				has thought about this and includes an API that enables exactly this - <a
					href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html"
					class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">torch.onnx</a
				>. <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> is an open standard that defines the operators that make
				up models. The PyTorch ONNX APIs take the Pythonic PyTorch code and turn it into a functional
				graph that captures the operators that are needed to run the model without Python. As with everything
				in machine learning, there are some limitations to be aware of. Some PyTorch models cannot be
				represented as a single graph - in this case you may need to output several graphs and stitch
				them together in your own pipeline.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				The popular Hugging Face library also has APIs that build on top of this torch.onnx
				functionality to export models to the ONNX format. Over <a
					href="https://huggingface.co/blog/ort-accelerating-hf-models"
					class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">130,000 models</a
				> are supported making it very likely that the model you care about is one of them.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				In this article, we'll show you several examples involving state-of-the-art PyTorch models
				(like Whisper and Stable Diffusion) on popular devices (like Windows laptops, mobile phones,
				and web browsers) via various languages (from C# to JavaScript to Swift).
			</p>

			<h2 class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline text-3xl mb-4">Examples of PyTorch models on the edge</h2>

			<h3 class=" text-2xl mb-2">Stable Diffusion on Windows</h3>

			<p class="mb-4">
				The Stable Diffusion pipeline consists of five PyTorch models that build an image from a
				text description. The diffusion process iterates on random pixels until the output image
				matches the description.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				To run on the edge, four of the models can be exported to ONNX format from HuggingFace.
			</p>
			<Highlight language={python} code={optimumcode} />
			<p class="mb-4">
				You don't have to export the fifth model, ClipTokenizer, as it is available in <a
					href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/extensions"
					class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">ONNX Runtime extensions</a
				>, a library for pre and post processing PyTorch models.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				To run this pipeline of models as a .NET application, we build the pipeline code in C#. This
				code can be run on CPU, GPU, or NPU, if they are available on your machine, using ONNX
				Runtime's device-specific hardware accelerators. This is configured with the <code
					class="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 p-1 rounded">ExecutionProviderTarget</code
				> below.
			</p>
			<Highlight language={csharp} code={dotnetcode} />
			<p class="mb-4">
				This is the output of the model pipeline, running with 50 inference iterations:
			</p>

			<img src={Puppies} alt="Two golden retriever puppies playing in the grass" class="mb-4" />

			<p class="mb-4">
				You can build the application and run it on Windows with the detailed steps shown in this <a
					href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/csharp/stable-diffusion-csharp.html"
					class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">tutorial</a
				>.
			</p>

			<h3 class=" text-2xl mb-2">Text generation in the browser</h3>

			<p class="mb-4">
				Running a PyTorch model locally in the browser is not only possible but super simple with
				the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index" class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline"
					>transformers.js</a
				> library. Transformers.js uses ONNX Runtime Web as its backend. Many models are already converted
				to ONNX and served by the tranformers.js CDN, making inference in the browser a matter of writing
				a few lines of HTML:
			</p>
			<Highlight language={handlebars} code={htmlcode} />
			<p class="mb-4">
				You can also embed the call to the transformers pipeline using vanilla JavaScript, or in a
				web application, with React or Next.js, or write a browser extension.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				ONNX Runtime Web currently uses web assembly to execute the model on the CPU. This is fine
				for many models but leveraging the GPU, if one exists on the device, can improve the user
				experience. ONNX Runtime Web support for WebGPU is coming *very* soon and enables you to tap
				into the GPU while use the same inference APIs.
			</p>

			<img
				src={TextGen}
				alt="Text generation in the browser using transformers.js. The prompt is Two golden retriever puppies are playing in the grass, and the response is playing in the grasslands. They are known for their playful nature and they have a playful face."
				class="mb-4 w-3/4"
			/>

			<h3 class=" text-2xl mb-2">Speech recognition with Whisper on mobile</h3>

			<p class="mb-4">
				Whisper from OpenAI is a PyTorch speech recognition model. Whisper comes in a number of
				different size variants - the smallest, Whisper Tiny, is suitable to run on mobile devices.
				All components of the Whisper Tiny model (audio decoder, encoder, decoder, and text sequence
				generation) can be composed and exported to a single ONNX model using the <a
					href="https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/whisper"
					class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">Olive framework</a
				>. To run this model as part of a mobile application, you can use ONNX Runtime Mobile, which
				supports Android, iOS, react-native, and MAUI/Xamarin.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				ONNX Runtime Mobile supports hardware acceleration via NNAPI (on Android), CoreML (on iOS),
				and XNNPACK (both iOS and Android).
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				The relevant snippet of a example <a
					href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-inference-examples/tree/main/mobile/examples/speech_recognition"
					class="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-800 underline">Android mobile app</a
				> that performs speech transcription on short samples of audio is shown below:
			</p>
			<Highlight language={kotlin} code={mobilecode} />
			<p class="mb-4">You can record a short audio clip to transcribe.</p>

			<img
				src={Speech}
				alt="Screenshot of an Android app to perform speech recognition using ONNX Runtime, running a PyTorch Whisper model"
				class="mb-4"
			/>

			<h3 class=" text-2xl mb-2">Train a model to recognize your voice on mobile</h3>

			<p class="mb-4">
				ONNX Runtime can also take a pre-trained model and adapt it to new data. It can do this on
				the edge - on mobile specifically where it is easy to record your voice, access your photos
				and other personalized data. Importantly, your data does not leave the device during
				training.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				For example, you can train a PyTorch model to recognize just your own voice on your mobile
				phone, for authentication scenarios.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				The PyTorch model is obtained from HuggingFace in your development environment, and extra
				layers are added to perform the speaker classification:
			</p>
			<Highlight language={python} code={torchcode} />
			<p class="mb-4">
				The model and other components necessary for training (a loss function to measure the
				quality of the model and an optimizer to instruct how the weights are adjusted during
				training) are exported with ONNX Runtime Training:
			</p>
			<Highlight language={python} code={trainingcode} />
			<p class="mb-4">
				This set of artifacts is now ready to be loaded by the mobile app, shown here as iOS Swift
				code. The app asks the user for samples of their voice and the model is trained with the
				samples.
			</p>
			<Highlight language={swift} code={swiftcode} />
			<p class="mb-4">
				Once the model is trained, you can run it to verify that a voice sample is you!
			</p>

			<h3 class=" text-2xl mb-2">Where to next?</h3>

			<p class="mb-4">
				In this article we've shown why you would run PyTorch models on the edge and what aspects to
				consider. We also shared several examples with code that you can use for running
				state-of-the-art PyTorch models on the edge with ONNX Runtime. We also showed how ONNX
				Runtime was built for performance and cross-platform execution, making it the ideal way to
				run PyTorch models on the edge. Have fun running PyTorch models on the edge with ONNX
				Runtime!
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				You may have noticed that we didn't include a Llama2 example even though ONNX Runtime is
				optimized to run it. That's because the amazing Llama2 model deserves its own article, so
				stay tuned for that!
